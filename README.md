# Pizza Parlor Website

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

##### This webpage was created to help further my knowledge with using arrays and looping in Javascript. When you arrive on the page, you will be instructed to input a number in the provided box and once you click the "see your result" button, it will give you a number of outcomes. This page was set up so that any inputed number with "1" in it will return the word "Beep!". Any input value with the number "2" in it, will return with the word "Boop!". Any input value with the number "3" in it, will return with the phrase "Won't you be my neighbor?". If a number is inputted but does not contain any of those three numbers, it will simply list the string of numbers back to you.
