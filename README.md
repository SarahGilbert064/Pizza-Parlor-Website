# Pizza Parlor Website

### Created by Sarah Gilbert

## Description

##### This webpage was created to help further my knowledge with the use of constructors, objects and prototypes. I created a pizza parlar that lets you pick our the size of pizza you would like and any toppings that are listed. The sizes are displayed in a drop down, while the toppings are displayed in clickable checkboxes. Once the size and toppings have been chosen, the user can click the "Order Total" button and your total price will be displayed! 


## Specifications

## Known Bugs
#### Currently I have a bug in the if/else statements. The first statement wiorks great with providing a price for each size, however only the first part of the second statement works. If you pick your size and then pick the first topping, you will get the correct price. However if you click any other topping, or multiple toppings, your price will be incorrect.
